**[Screen: Problem Statistics/Animation]**

## üè≠ SME Journey - Tokenizing an Invoice (0:30 - 1:45)

**[Screen: InvoiceFlow Homepage]**

> "Let me show you how this works. I'm Sarah, owner of TechParts Manufacturing. I just delivered $50,000 worth of components to AutoCorp, but they won't pay me for 60 days. I need cash now to fulfill my next order."

### Step 1: Connect Wallet (0:30 - 0:40)
**[Action: Click 'Connect Wallet']**

> "First, I connect my MetaMask wallet to the XDC Apothem testnet. Notice how fast this connection is - that's the power of XDC's enterprise-grade infrastructure."

### Step 2: Access SME Dashboard (0:40 - 0:50)
**[Action: Navigate to SME Dashboard]**

**[Show: Dashboard with previous invoices, statistics]**

### Step 3: Create New Invoice (0:50 - 1:30)
**[Action: Fill out invoice form]**

> "Let me tokenize my new invoice. I enter:
> - Client: AutoCorp's wallet address
> - Face Value: $50,000 - what AutoCorp will pay in 60 days
> - Sale Price: $47,000 - what I want now (6% discount for immediate liquidity)
> - Due Date: 60 days from today
> - Invoice details: Components delivery confirmation"

**[Show: Form being filled out with real values]**

### Step 4: Mint Invoice NFT (1:30 - 1:45)
