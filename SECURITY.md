# Security Guidelines

## üîí Private Key Management

### ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Never commit private keys to version control

**What happened:** A private key was accidentally committed to the repository, which is a serious security vulnerability.

**What we did to fix it:**
1. ‚úÖ Removed private key from current files
2. ‚úÖ Rewrote Git history using `git filter-branch` to remove private key from all commits
3. ‚úÖ Force pushed cleaned history to GitHub
4. ‚úÖ Cleaned up local Git references and garbage collected

### üõ°Ô∏è Best Practices

1. **Environment Variables**
   - Always use placeholder values in `.env.example`
   - Never commit actual private keys, API keys, or secrets
   - Use `your_private_key_here` or similar placeholders

2. **Local Development**
   - Keep actual private keys only in `.env` (which is gitignored)
   - Generate new private keys for each environment
   - Never share private keys through chat, email, or other channels

3. **Repository Security**
   - Regularly audit commits for sensitive information
   - Use tools like `git-secrets` to prevent accidental commits
   - Review all files before committing

### üîÑ If Private Key Exposure Happens Again

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   ```bash
   # 1. Generate new private key immediately
   # 2. Update all services using the old key
   # 3. Remove from current files
   git add .env.example
   git commit -m "security: Remove exposed private key"
   
   # 4. Rewrite history to remove from all commits
   git filter-branch --force --index-filter 'git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch .env.example' --prune-empty --tag-name-filter cat -- --all
   
   # 5. Force push to remote
   git push --force origin main
   git push --force origin [branch-name]
   
   # 6. Clean up local references
   rm -rf .git/refs/original/
   git reflog expire --expire=now --all
   git gc --prune=now --aggressive
   ```

2. **Post-Incident:**
   - Rotate all related credentials
   - Monitor for any unauthorized access
   - Review and improve security practices

### üìã Security Checklist

Before every commit:
- [ ] No private keys in any files
- [ ] No API keys or secrets exposed
- [ ] `.env.example` contains only placeholder values
- [ ] Sensitive data is properly gitignored

### üö® Emergency Contacts

If you discover a security vulnerability:
1. Do not commit or push anything
2. Immediately rotate any exposed credentials
3. Follow the incident response procedure above
4. Document the incident and lessons learned
